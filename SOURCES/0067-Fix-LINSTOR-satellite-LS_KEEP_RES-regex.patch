Subject: [PATCH] Fix LINSTOR satellite LS_KEEP_RES regex

The original regex is not correct: luckily it matches resources like
`xcp-persistent-database` but also these resources:
`xcp-persisten`, `xcp-persistenttttttt`...

Also this issue has no real impact in production. It's just a typo.

After this fix we can still match patterns like "xcp-persistenttttttt" but
the goal here is to avoid detection of persistent volumes whose name contains
only the prefix `xcp-persisten` instead of `xcp-persistent`.

We could use more complex regexes, but I don't know where we're going with
SMAPIv3 and possible persistent volume features. So I don't prefer to use
more restrictive regexes for now.
