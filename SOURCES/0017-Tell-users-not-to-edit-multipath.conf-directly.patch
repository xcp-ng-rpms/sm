Subject: [PATCH 17/21] Tell users not to edit multipath.conf directly

This file is meant to remain unchanged and regularly updated along with
the SM component. Users can create a custom configuration file in
/etc/multipath/conf.d/ instead.

(cherry picked from commit b44d3f5db6d22d5a649fffebebb284afd6da39f7)
